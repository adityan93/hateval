# Trial data #

In this repository you will find example files for SemEval 2019 - Task 5, released during the  **Practice** phase. The files are:

* *trial_en.tsv*: it includes English tweets about hate speech against women and immigrants
* *trial_es.tsv*: it includes Spanish tweets about hate speech against women and immigrants

Trial datasets are released in this phase in order to show how the official training data will look like, and to allow participants to try out uploading a submission on CodaLab.

### File format ###
The labelled data have the same format independently of the task and language. It consists of a tab-separated file with one line per tweet containing per line the tweet id, its content, and three binary values espressing the presence of hateful contents, whether the target is a whole group or a single individual, and whether incitement to hate is expressed with an aggressive language.
For a detailed description of the format, see also the task page on Codalab: METTERE LINK UFFICIALE!!!
