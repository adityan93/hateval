<p style="text-align: justify">
For the evaluation of the results of task A and B different strategies and metrics are applied in order to allow for more fine-grained scores.
</p>

<pp style="text-align: justify">
<strong>TASK A.</strong><br/>
Systems will be evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The submissions will be ranked by F1-score.<br/> 

The metrics will be computed as follows:
<ul>
<li><i>Accuracy</i> = (number of correctly predicted instances) / (total number of instances)
<li><i>Precision</i> = (number of correctly predicted instances) / (number of predicted labels)
<li><i>Recall</i> = (number of correctly predicted labels) / (number of labels in the gold standard)
<li><i>F1-score</i> = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision * Recall)
</ul>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong>TASK B.</strong> 
Systems will be evaluated on the basis of two criteria: partial match and exact match.
<br/> 
<ul>

<li><strong>Partial match</strong>: each dimension to be predicted (Hate Speech HS, Target TR and Aggressiveness AG) will be evaluated independently from the others using standard evaluation metrics, including <i>accuracy</i>, <i>precision</i>, <i>recall</i> and <i>F1-score</i> as defined above. The report for each participant will include all the measures and a summary of the performance in terms of macro-average <i>F1-score</i>, computed as follows:<br/>

 <i>F1-score</i> = (F1(HS) + F1(AG) + F1(TR)) / 3 <br><br>
 
 <li><strong>Exact match</strong>: all the dimensions to be predicted will be jointly considered computing the <i>Exact Match Ratio</i> (Kazawa, 2005). Given the multi-label dataset consisting of n multi-label samples (x<sub>i</sub>,Y<sub>i</sub>), where x<sub>i</sub> denotes the i-th instance and Y<sub>i</sub> represents the corresponding set of labels to be predicted (HS &isin; {0,1}, TR &isin; {0,1} and AG &isin; {0,1}), the Exact Match Ratio (EMR) will be computed as follows:<br/>

 
 <div class="eq-c">
<i>EMR</i> =
<div class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</div>
<span class="intsuma">
<span class="lim">n</span>
<span class="sum-frac">&sum;</span>
<span class="lim"><i>i</i>=1</span>
</span>
I(Y<sub>i</sub>,Z<sub>i</sub>)
</div>

  
where Z<sub>i</sub> denotes the set of labels predicted for the i-th instance and I is the indicator function.<br/><br/><br/> 

The submissions will be ranked by <i>EMR</i>. This choice is motivated by the willingness of capturing the most difficult task of capturing the entire phenomena, and therefore to identify the most dangerous behaviours against the targets.
